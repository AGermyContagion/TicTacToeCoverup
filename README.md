TicTacToeCoverup
=================

A variation of a regular Tic Tac Toe game where you can cover other the other player's pieces.

The game will ask each player for their names. Then it will ask Player 1 what symbols they want to use for that game.

Each player gets unlimited small pieces, 1 medium piece, and 1 large piece. An example of this would be: X = ["*", "x", "X"] O = [".", "o", "O"]

Gameplay: 
1. A player will start out by putting a small piece anywhere on the board that they want. Small pieces are default for empty spots. You cannot place a medium or large piece onto an empty spot. 
2. If Player 2 decides that he wants to cover Player 1's piece then Player 2 needs to have an available medium or large piece left. Player 2's piece also has to be larger than Player 1's in order for it to cover it. 
3. The first person to have three symbols in a row wins. The symbols do not have to be the same, they just have to belong to the same player.
